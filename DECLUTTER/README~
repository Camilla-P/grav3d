Instructions to produce model outputs used in figures 5,6,7,8 of Penney & Copley, "Lateral variations in lower crustal strength control the temporal evolution of mountain ranges: examples from south-east Tibet"
For further information, or if you would like to adapt or use the code for *any* other purpose, please contact Camilla Penney (cp451@cam.ac.uk) or Alex Copley (acc41@cam.ac.uk).

The main script is grav3d.f - the set up process for using this to run the different models used in the paper is described below, and the boundary conditions and model are described in the paper, with the main equations derived in Pattyn, 2003 (https://doi.org/10.1029/2002JB002329).

>in grav3d.f in this directory change dirname to have the path to where you will run the code 
> create the directory structure by running setup.sh (change paths in setup.sh first), calls setup.py and shapes.py
> go into each folder and replace // with /${dir}/ in dirname where dir is e.g. sym_0 
> change ylength and erodek in grav3d.inp
> for asym_1 can change to have reflection bc on all of i=n (faster)

WHAT IS THE CODE DOING?

Boundary conditions are as shown in Figure 4 
Now have H fixed on influx (j=1, 65km) and beyond basins (40km)
u=0 dv/dy=0 on j=1
u=0 dv/dx=0 on on i=1,nptsx j<ylength
du/dx=0 dv/dx=0 on i=1,nptsx j>ylength
dv/dy =0 du/dy=0 on j=nptsy
